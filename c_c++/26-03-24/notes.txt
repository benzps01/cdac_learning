SOLID Principles

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): There should be exactly one reason for changing 
					  the functionality supported by an object.

---> Rule: Define members in class which are required by all of its instances in an identical manner.

2. Open Closed Principle (OCP): The functionality exposed by an object should be open for extension but closed for modification.

--> Rule: Use an instance of a class only by calling methods defined by that class.
