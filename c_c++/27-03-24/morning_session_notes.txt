Static method
Whenever we find any methods which does not depend on instance of a class, we use static keyword.

Static member function is independent of instance data and such a method does not require 'this' argument and it can be called directly on the class (using :: operator)

Non-static member function depends on instance data which it addresses using 'this' argument, such a method must be called on an object (using . operator)

Banner b; -> b will be allocated to stack memory

ulimit -s -> gives the memory allocated for the program.
stack memory is small. Good for small objects, but not for large ones.

"new" operator makes a space on the heap memory for the object;
eg: 
banner* b = new Banner(20, 1);

new operator dynamically allocates memory for an instance on the heap and returns the address of this instance. Such an instance must be explicitly deactivated using delete operator.
Here address of b will be allocated in the stack, but data will be on heap.


Banner a; Here data and address will be on stack;

automatically allocating memory for an instance on stack; such an instance will be automatically deactivated when its identifier goes out of scope;
