Pointers

int* p = &q

in ptrs p[0] = 35 can also be done as *p = 35;
but other memory location can be accessed using p[1] or p[-1] or p[2];


eg:						
						This is declaring pointer
double Average(double first, double second, double* deviation)
{
	//assigning value at [0] where the pointer is pointing

        deviation[0] = first > second ? (first - second) / 2 : (second - first) / 2;

		//or

	*deviation = first > second ? (first - second) / 2 : (second - first) / 2;

        return (first + second) / 2;
}
		//here in &d we are asking deviation to store value at memory location of %d;
 a = Average(b, c, &d);
        printf("Average is %lf with a deviation of %lf\n",a, d);


Mangled Name for pointers are _Z7AverageddPd  -> if pointers datatype are double then mangled name contains Pd for pointer.
